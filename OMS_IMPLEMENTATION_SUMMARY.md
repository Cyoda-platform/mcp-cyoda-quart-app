# Cyoda OMS Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Order Management System (OMS) using the Cyoda Python client application framework. The implementation follows all established patterns and includes 5 core entities with complete workflows, processors, criteria, and UI-facing REST API endpoints.

## Implemented Entities

### 1. Product Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/product/version_1/product.py`
- **Features**: Complex schema with attributes, localizations, media, options, variants, bundles, inventory, compliance, relationships, and events
- **Workflow**: `application/resources/workflow/product/version_1/Product.json`
- **States**: initial_state → created → validated → active ⇄ inactive
- **Processors**: ProductInventoryProcessor
- **Criteria**: ProductValidationCriterion

### 2. Cart Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/cart/version_1/cart.py`
- **Features**: Shopping cart with line items, totals calculation, guest contact information
- **Workflow**: `application/resources/workflow/cart/version_1/Cart.json`
- **States**: initial_state → new → active → checking_out → converted
- **Processors**: CartTotalsProcessor (recalculates totals on item changes)

### 3. Payment Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/payment/version_1/payment.py`
- **Features**: Dummy payment processing with auto-approval after 3 seconds
- **Workflow**: `application/resources/workflow/payment/version_1/Payment.json`
- **States**: initial_state → initiated → paid/failed/canceled
- **Processors**: PaymentInitiationProcessor, DummyPaymentProcessor

### 4. Order Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/order/version_1/order.py`
- **Features**: Order lifecycle management with ULID order numbers, guest contact, line items
- **Workflow**: `application/resources/workflow/order/version_1/Order.json`
- **States**: initial_state → waiting_to_fulfill → picking → waiting_to_send → sent → delivered
- **Processors**: OrderCreationProcessor (creates from paid cart, decrements stock, creates shipment)

### 5. Shipment Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/shipment/version_1/shipment.py`
- **Features**: Shipping management with status tracking, line items, tracking numbers
- **Workflow**: `application/resources/workflow/shipment/version_1/Shipment.json`
- **States**: initial_state → picking → waiting_to_send → sent → delivered
- **Processors**: ShipmentTrackingProcessor
- **Criteria**: ShipmentReadyCriterion

## UI-Facing REST API Endpoints

### Products API (`/ui/products`)
- `GET /ui/products` - List products with search/filtering (search, category, minPrice, maxPrice, pagination)
- `GET /ui/products/{sku}` - Get product detail by SKU

### Cart API (`/ui/cart`)
- `POST /ui/cart` - Create new cart
- `GET /ui/cart/{cart_id}` - Get cart by ID
- `POST /ui/cart/{cart_id}/lines` - Add/increment line item
- `PATCH /ui/cart/{cart_id}/lines` - Update/remove line item
- `POST /ui/cart/{cart_id}/open-checkout` - Set cart to CHECKING_OUT status

### Checkout API (`/ui/checkout`)
- `POST /ui/checkout/{cart_id}` - Attach guest contact information to cart

### Payment API (`/ui/payment`)
- `POST /ui/payment/start` - Start payment process (returns paymentId)
- `GET /ui/payment/{payment_id}` - Get payment status for polling

### Order API (`/ui/order`)
- `POST /ui/order/create` - Create order from paid cart and payment
- `GET /ui/order/{order_id}` - Get order details

## Key Features Implemented

### Business Logic
- **Cart Management**: Automatic totals calculation, status transitions (NEW → ACTIVE → CHECKING_OUT → CONVERTED)
- **Payment Processing**: Dummy payment with 3-second auto-approval simulation
- **Order Creation**: Automatic order creation from paid cart with stock decrement and shipment creation
- **Inventory Management**: Product stock decrement when orders are created
- **Shipment Tracking**: Automatic tracking number generation and status management

### Technical Implementation
- **Entity Validation**: Comprehensive field validation with Pydantic
- **Workflow Management**: All entities follow proper state transitions with manual/automatic flags
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance with proper type hints
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling in all processors and routes
- **Code Quality**: Passes all quality checks (black, isort, flake8, mypy, bandit)

### Data Flow
1. **Product Catalog**: Products are validated and activated through workflow
2. **Shopping Cart**: Items added to cart with automatic totals calculation
3. **Checkout Process**: Guest contact information attached to cart
4. **Payment**: Dummy payment initiated and auto-approved after 3 seconds
5. **Order Creation**: Order created from paid cart, stock decremented, shipment created
6. **Fulfillment**: Shipment progresses through picking → waiting_to_send → sent → delivered

## Configuration Updates
- **Services Config**: All processors and criteria registered in `services/config.py`
- **Application Routes**: All UI route blueprints registered in `application/app.py`
- **Workflow Validation**: All workflows validated against schema

## Code Quality Results
- ✅ **mypy**: No type errors (143 source files checked)
- ✅ **black**: Code formatted successfully
- ✅ **isort**: Imports sorted correctly
- ✅ **flake8**: No style violations
- ✅ **bandit**: Only low-severity warnings in test files (acceptable for demo)

## Architecture Compliance
- ✅ **Interface-based design**: All entities extend CyodaEntity
- ✅ **Workflow-driven**: All business logic flows through Cyoda workflows
- ✅ **Thin routes**: Pure proxies to EntityService with no business logic
- ✅ **Manual transitions**: All entity updates use explicit manual transitions
- ✅ **Technical IDs**: Preferred for performance in responses
- ✅ **Business IDs**: Used for entity references (SKU, cartId, etc.)

## Functional Requirements Compliance
All requirements from `application/resources/functional_requirements/` have been implemented:
- ✅ Complete Product schema with all complex nested structures
- ✅ Cart management with status transitions and totals calculation
- ✅ Dummy payment processing with auto-approval
- ✅ Order creation with stock decrement and shipment creation
- ✅ UI-facing REST API endpoints for all operations
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation throughout

## Next Steps
The OMS implementation is complete and ready for use. All entities, workflows, processors, criteria, and API endpoints are functional and follow Cyoda best practices. The system can be extended with additional features as needed while maintaining the established patterns.
