### 4. Validation Criteria (3 criteria)

#### ProductValidationCriterion (`application/criterion/product_validation_criterion.py`)
- **Validates**: Required fields, field constraints, business rules, category-specific rules
- **Checks**: Name length, category validity, non-negative values, stock consistency

#### ReportValidationCriterion (`application/criterion/report_validation_criterion.py`)
- **Validates**: Title format, report type, data period consistency, email configuration
- **Checks**: Content length, date formats, recipient validation

#### EmailValidationCriterion (`application/criterion/email_validation_criterion.py`)
- **Validates**: Email formats, delivery constraints, status consistency, type-specific rules
- **Checks**: Recipient format, retry limits, timestamp order

### 5. API Routes (3 route modules)

#### Products API (`application/routes/products.py`)
- **Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations, search, transitions, business ID lookup
- **Features**: Category/status filtering, performance score filtering, pagination
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation, error handling

#### Reports API (`application/routes/reports.py`)
