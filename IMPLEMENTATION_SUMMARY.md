# Product Performance Analysis and Reporting System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Product Performance Analysis and Reporting System using the Cyoda framework. The system automates data extraction from Pet Store API, analyzes product performance metrics, generates detailed reports, and sends email notifications to the sales team.

## Architecture

The implementation follows the Cyoda framework patterns with three main entities:

### 1. Product Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/product/version_1/product.py`
- **Purpose**: Stores product data from Pet Store API for performance analysis
- **Key Features**:
  - Product information (name, category, status, price)
  - Sales metrics (sales volume, revenue)
  - Inventory data (stock levels, reorder points)
  - Performance indicators (performance score, turnover rate)
  - API source tracking

### 2. Report Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/report/version_1/report.py`
- **Purpose**: Manages generated performance analysis reports
- **Key Features**:
  - Report metadata (title, type, period)
  - Performance insights (top performers, underperformers, low stock)
  - Revenue and growth metrics
  - Email delivery tracking
  - File information

### 3. DataExtraction Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/data_extraction/version_1/data_extraction.py`
- **Purpose**: Tracks data extraction jobs from Pet Store API
- **Key Features**:
  - Job configuration (API endpoints, schedule)
  - Execution status and timing
  - Data quality metrics
  - Error handling and retry logic

## Workflows

Each entity has a dedicated workflow with proper state transitions:

### Product Workflow
- **States**: initial_state → created → validated → analyzed → archived
- **Processors**: ProductAnalysisProcessor
- **Criteria**: ProductValidationCriterion

### Report Workflow
- **States**: initial_state → created → validated → generated → sent → archived

- **Criteria**: ReportValidationCriterion

### DataExtraction Workflow
- **States**: initial_state → created → validated → extracting → completed/failed → scheduled/archived
- **Processors**: DataExtractionProcessor
- **Criteria**: DataExtractionValidationCriterion

## Processors

  - Mock email service integration

## Validation Criteria

### 1. ProductValidationCriterion
- **Location**: `application/criterion/product_validation_criterion.py`
- **Validates**: Product data quality and business rules
- **Checks**: Required fields, data ranges, business logic, API data integrity

### 2. ReportValidationCriterion
- **Location**: `application/criterion/report_validation_criterion.py`
- **Validates**: Report configuration and data integrity
- **Checks**: Report metadata, date ranges, email configuration, settings

### 3. DataExtractionValidationCriterion
- **Location**: `application/criterion/data_extraction_validation_criterion.py`
- **Validates**: API configuration and extraction settings
- **Checks**: API endpoints, extraction parameters, schedule configuration

## API Routes

### Products API (`/api/products`)
- **Location**: `application/routes/products.py`
- **Endpoints**: CRUD operations with filtering and pagination
- **Features**: Category, status, and state filtering

### Reports API (`/api/reports`)
- **Location**: `application/routes/reports.py`
- **Endpoints**: CRUD operations with filtering and pagination
- **Features**: Report type, email status, and state filtering

### Data Extractions API (`/api/data-extractions`)
- **Location**: `application/routes/data_extractions.py`
- **Endpoints**: CRUD operations with filtering and pagination
- **Features**: Status, extraction type, and state filtering
