# Pet Store Performance Analysis System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Pet Store Performance Analysis System that integrates with the Pet Store API to provide automated data extraction, analysis, and reporting capabilities. The system follows the Cyoda framework patterns and provides a complete solution for sales team performance monitoring.

## System Architecture

### Core Entities

1. **Product Entity** (`application/entity/product/version_1/product.py`)
   - Represents pet store products with performance metrics
   - Integrates Pet Store API data (pet_id, name, category, status, photos, tags)
   - Includes performance analytics (sales_volume, revenue, performance_score, trend_indicator)
   - Supports inventory management (inventory_count, restock_needed)
   - Workflow states: initial_state → extracted → validated → analyzed → completed

2. **Report Entity** (`application/entity/report/version_1/report.py`)
   - Weekly performance analysis reports for the sales team
   - Contains high performers, underperformers, and restock recommendations
   - Supports multiple formats (PDF, HTML, JSON)
   - Email delivery to victoria.sagdieva@cyoda.com
   - Workflow states: initial_state → created → validated → generated → sent → completed

3. **DataExtraction Entity** (`application/entity/data_extraction/version_1/data_extraction.py`)
   - Scheduled data extraction jobs from Pet Store API
   - Configurable API endpoints and retry mechanisms
   - Tracks execution status and success rates
   - Creates Product entities from extracted data
   - Workflow states: initial_state → scheduled → validated → running → completed/failed

### Processors

1. **ProductAnalysisProcessor** (`application/processor/product_analysis_processor.py`)
   - Calculates performance metrics and scores
   - Determines trend indicators (RISING, STABLE, DECLINING)
   - Analyzes inventory status and restocking needs
   - Updates analysis timestamps

2. **ReportGenerationProcessor** (`application/processor/report_generation_processor.py`)
   - Fetches and analyzes all Product entities
   - Generates comprehensive performance reports
   - Creates HTML/JSON content for email delivery
   - Calculates summary metrics and trends

3. **ReportEmailProcessor** (`application/processor/report_email_processor.py`)
   - Handles email delivery of generated reports
   - Creates formatted email content with executive summary
   - Simulates email sending (ready for real SMTP integration)
   - Updates email delivery status

4. **DataExtractionProcessor** (`application/processor/data_extraction_processor.py`)
   - Extracts data from Pet Store API endpoints
   - Handles API errors and retry logic
   - Creates/updates Product entities from API data
   - Tracks extraction success rates

### Validation Criteria

1. **ProductValidationCriterion** (`application/criterion/product_validation_criterion.py`)
   - Validates product data consistency
   - Checks business logic rules (sales vs revenue)
   - Ensures required fields are present

2. **ReportValidationCriterion** (`application/criterion/report_validation_criterion.py`)
   - Validates report configuration and recipients
   - Checks date ranges and business logic
   - Ensures email configuration is correct

3. **DataExtractionValidationCriterion** (`application/criterion/data_extraction_validation_criterion.py`)
   - Validates API configuration and endpoints
   - Checks retry settings and execution status
   - Ensures job is ready for execution

### API Routes

1. **Products API** (`application/routes/products.py`)
   - Full CRUD operations for Product entities
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Performance score filtering
   - Workflow transition support

2. **Reports API** (`application/routes/reports.py`)
   - Report generation and management
   - Content retrieval for viewing/download
   - Email status tracking
   - Period-based filtering

3. **Data Extractions API** (`application/routes/data_extractions.py`)
   - Job scheduling and management
   - Manual trigger capability
   - Status monitoring and retry control
   - Success rate tracking

## Key Features

### Pet Store API Integration
- Connects to https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3
- Extracts pet data from multiple status endpoints
- Handles API errors and rate limiting
- Creates Product entities with performance metrics

### Performance Analysis
- Calculates performance scores (0-100) based on sales and revenue
- Determines trend indicators (RISING, STABLE, DECLINING)
- Identifies high performers (score ≥ 70) and underperformers (score ≤ 30)
- Tracks inventory levels and restocking needs

### Automated Reporting
- Generates weekly performance reports
- Includes executive summary and key highlights
- Lists high performers, underperformers, and restock recommendations
- Supports HTML and JSON formats
- Automated email delivery to sales team

### Scheduling and Automation
- Configurable cron-based scheduling (default: Mondays at 9 AM)
- Automatic workflow progression
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Technical Implementation

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance with comprehensive type hints
- **Code Style**: Black formatting and isort import organization
- **Linting**: Flake8 compliance with 88-character line limit
- **Security**: Bandit security scanning with no high/medium issues
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns following Cyoda patterns

### Workflow Management
- JSON-based workflow definitions validated against schema
- Automatic and manual transitions as appropriate
- State-based entity lifecycle management
- Processor and criteria integration

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with comprehensive validation
- Pydantic models for request/response handling
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- OpenAPI documentation via Quart-Schema

## Configuration

### Service Registration
- All processors and criteria registered in `services/config.py`
- Blueprint registration in `application/app.py`
- Proper module discovery and loading

### Workflow Validation
