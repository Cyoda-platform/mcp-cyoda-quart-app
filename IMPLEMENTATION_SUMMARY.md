# Pet Store Performance Analysis System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a comprehensive Pet Store Performance Analysis System built using the Cyoda platform framework. The system automates data extraction from the Pet Store API, performs performance analysis, and generates weekly reports that are automatically emailed to the sales team.

## System Architecture

The system follows the Cyoda framework patterns with three main entities, each with their own workflows, processors, and validation criteria:

### 1. Product Entity
**Purpose**: Represents pet store products with performance metrics and sales data.

**Key Fields**:
- Core product data: name, category, status
- Performance metrics: sales volume, revenue, stock level
- Analysis results: performance score, inventory turnover rate
- API tracking: source API ID, extraction timestamps

**Workflow States**: initial_state → created → validated → analyzed → completed

### 2. Report Entity  
**Purpose**: Represents weekly performance analysis reports with insights and email dispatch tracking.

**Key Fields**:
- Report metadata: title, type, period dates
- Analysis content: executive summary, top performers, underperformers, restock recommendations
- Analytics data: total revenue, sales volume, average performance score
- Email tracking: recipients, dispatch status, timestamps

**Workflow States**: initial_state → created → generated → validated → emailed

### 3. DataExtraction Entity
**Purpose**: Tracks API data extraction jobs and their execution status.

**Key Fields**:
- Job configuration: name, API endpoint, extraction type, frequency
- Execution tracking: start/completion times, duration, status
- Results: records extracted/processed/failed, data quality score
- Error handling: retry count, error messages, validation errors

**Workflow States**: initial_state → created → started → validated → completed

## Core Components

### Processors

#### ProductAnalysisProcessor
- Calculates performance scores based on sales volume, revenue, and stock levels
- Computes inventory turnover rates
- Updates product metrics for reporting

#### ReportGenerationProcessor  
- Retrieves analyzed product data
- Generates comprehensive performance reports with:
  - Executive summary with key insights
  - Top 5 performing products
  - Bottom 5 underperforming products  
  - Restock recommendations for low-stock, high-turnover items
  - Overall analytics (total revenue, sales volume, average scores)

#### EmailDispatchProcessor
- Formats and sends weekly reports via email
- Tracks email dispatch status and handles failures
- Generates user-friendly email content with key metrics

#### PetStoreApiProcessor
- Simulates data extraction from Pet Store API
- Creates Product entities from API data
- Tracks extraction metrics and data quality

### Validation Criteria

#### ProductValidationCriterion
- Validates product data integrity
- Ensures required fields are present and valid
- Checks business logic rules (e.g., sold products have no stock)

#### ReportValidationCriterion
- Ensures reports have complete content before email dispatch
- Validates email recipients and report structure
- Checks for meaningful analysis content

#### DataExtractionValidationCriterion
- Validates successful completion of extraction jobs
- Ensures minimum data quality thresholds (50% success rate)
- Checks extraction timing and result metrics

### API Routes

Complete REST API endpoints for all entities:
- **Products**: `/api/products` - CRUD operations, search, count
- **Reports**: `/api/reports` - CRUD operations, filtering by type/status  
- **Data Extractions**: `/api/data-extractions` - CRUD operations, job management

All routes follow thin proxy patterns with comprehensive validation and error handling.
