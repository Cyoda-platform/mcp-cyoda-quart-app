# Pet Store Performance Analysis System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Pet Store Performance Analysis System using the Cyoda Python client application framework. The system automates data extraction from the Pet Store API, performs performance analysis, and generates weekly reports that are automatically emailed to victoria.sagdieva@cyoda.com.

## Architecture

The system follows the established Cyoda patterns with three main entities:

### 1. Product Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/product/version_1/product.py`
- **Purpose**: Represents pet store products with sales data, inventory levels, and performance metrics
- **Key Fields**: 
  - Product identification (product_id, name, category, status)
  - Sales metrics (sales_volume, revenue, price)
  - Inventory data (inventory_level, inventory_turnover_rate)
  - Performance analysis (performance_score, trend_indicator)
- **Workflow States**: initial_state → extracted → validated → analyzed → reported

### 2. Report Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/report/version_1/report.py`
- **Purpose**: Represents weekly performance reports with analysis results and email dispatch status
- **Key Fields**:
  - Report metadata (title, period, type)
  - Analysis results (top_performing_products, underperforming_products, low_stock_items)
  - Email configuration (recipient_email, email_status)
  - Insights (executive_summary, sales_trends, inventory_insights)
- **Workflow States**: initial_state → generated → validated → emailed

### 3. DataExtraction Entity
- **Location**: `application/entity/data_extraction/version_1/data_extraction.py`
- **Purpose**: Tracks automated data collection processes from Pet Store API
- **Key Fields**:
  - Scheduling (extraction_type, scheduled_day, scheduled_time)
  - Execution tracking (execution_status, last_execution_at)
  - Data quality (data_quality_score, products_extracted)
  - Error handling (error_count, retry_count)
- **Workflow States**: initial_state → scheduled → executing → validated → completed

## Processors Implementation

### Product Processors
1. **ProductAnalysisProcessor** (`application/processor/product_analysis_processor.py`)
   - Calculates performance metrics and KPIs
   - Determines trend indicators (RISING, FALLING, STABLE)
   - Computes inventory turnover rates
   - Assigns performance scores (0-100)

2. **ProductReportingProcessor** (`application/processor/product_reporting_processor.py`)
   - Creates weekly Report entities automatically
   - Categorizes products by performance level
   - Updates reports with product data
   - Manages report aggregation

### Report Processors
1. **ReportGenerationProcessor** (`application/processor/report_generation_processor.py`)
   - Generates executive summaries
   - Creates sales trend analysis
   - Produces inventory insights and recommendations
   - Compiles comprehensive report data

2. **ReportEmailProcessor** (`application/processor/report_email_processor.py`)
   - Formats email content with executive summary
   - Prepares attachments (simulated)
   - Handles email dispatch (simulated)
   - Tracks delivery status

### DataExtraction Processor
1. **DataExtractionProcessor** (`application/processor/data_extraction_processor.py`)
   - Simulates Pet Store API data extraction
   - Creates Product entities from extracted data
   - Calculates data quality scores
   - Handles error tracking and retry logic

## Validation Criteria

### 1. ProductValidationCriterion
- **Location**: `application/criterion/product_validation_criterion.py`
- Validates required fields and data formats
- Checks business rules (sold products have sales, available products have inventory)
- Ensures data consistency (revenue calculations, inventory turnover)

### 2. ReportValidationCriterion
- **Location**: `application/criterion/report_validation_criterion.py`
- Validates report completeness and content quality
- Checks email configuration and recipient format
- Ensures business logic compliance

### 3. DataExtractionValidationCriterion
- **Location**: `application/criterion/data_extraction_validation_criterion.py`
- Validates extraction success and data quality
- Checks minimum data quality thresholds (70%)
- Ensures reasonable extraction metrics

## API Routes

### Product Routes (`/api/products`)
- **Location**: `application/routes/products.py`
- Full CRUD operations with filtering by category, status, performance
- Workflow transition support
- Search functionality

### Report Routes (`/api/reports`)
- **Location**: `application/routes/reports.py`
- CRUD operations with filtering by type and email status
- Report generation and email dispatch triggers

### DataExtraction Routes (`/api/data-extractions`)
- **Location**: `application/routes/data_extractions.py`
- CRUD operations with filtering by type, status, and schedule
- Manual extraction triggering

## Workflows

All workflows are defined in JSON format and validated against the schema:

1. **Product Workflow**: `application/resources/workflow/product/version_1/Product.json`
   - Automatic progression through extraction and validation
   - Manual reporting transition for controlled report generation

2. **Report Workflow**: `application/resources/workflow/report/version_1/Report.json`
   - Automatic report generation and validation
   - Automatic email dispatch

3. **DataExtraction Workflow**: `application/resources/workflow/data_extraction/version_1/DataExtraction.json`
   - Manual execution trigger for scheduled extractions
   - Automatic validation and completion

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automated Data Collection

- Configurable extraction schedules (weekly on Mondays)
- Data quality assessment and validation
- Error handling with retry mechanisms

### 2. Performance Analysis
- Multi-factor performance scoring (sales, revenue, inventory management)
- Trend analysis (rising, falling, stable indicators)
- Category-based benchmarking
- Inventory turnover calculations

### 3. Automated Reporting
- Weekly report generation with executive summaries
- Product categorization (top performers, underperformers, low stock)
