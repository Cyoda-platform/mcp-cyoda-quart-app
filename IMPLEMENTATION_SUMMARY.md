# Product Performance Analysis and Reporting System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Product Performance Analysis and Reporting System using the Cyoda Python client application framework. The system automates data extraction from the Pet Store API, analyzes product performance metrics, generates detailed reports, and delivers them via email to the sales team.

## Architecture

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. Entities (3 entities)
- **Product** (`application/entity/product/version_1/product.py`)
  - Stores product data from Pet Store API
  - Fields: name, category, status, price, inventory levels, performance metrics
  - Validation for product attributes and business rules

- **Report** (`application/entity/report/version_1/report.py`)
  - Manages generated performance analysis reports
  - Fields: title, content, summary, email status, insights, metrics
  - Email delivery tracking and report metadata

- **DataExtraction** (`application/entity/data_extraction/version_1/data_extraction.py`)
  - Tracks data extraction jobs and scheduling
  - Fields: extraction type, schedule pattern, results, error tracking
  - Retry logic and execution monitoring

#### 2. Workflows (3 workflows)
- **Product Workflow** (`application/resources/workflow/product/version_1/Product.json`)
  - States: initial_state → extracted → analyzed → completed
  - Triggers ProductAnalysisProcessor for performance calculations

- **Report Workflow** (`application/resources/workflow/report/version_1/Report.json`)
  - States: initial_state → generating → generated → emailed → completed
  - Includes ReportGenerationProcessor and EmailNotificationProcessor

- **DataExtraction Workflow** (`application/resources/workflow/data_extraction/version_1/DataExtraction.json`)
  - States: initial_state → scheduled → extracting → completed/failed
  - Handles ProductDataExtractionProcessor with retry logic

#### 3. Processors (4 processors)
- **ProductDataExtractionProcessor** (`application/processor/product_data_extraction_processor.py`)
  - Extracts data from Pet Store API endpoints
  - Creates Product entities with extracted data
  - Handles API errors and retry logic

- **ProductAnalysisProcessor** (`application/processor/product_analysis_processor.py`)
  - Calculates performance metrics (sales volume, revenue, inventory turnover)
  - Generates performance scores and identifies trends
  - Simulates realistic business metrics

- **ReportGenerationProcessor** (`application/processor/report_generation_processor.py`)
  - Generates comprehensive performance reports
  - Creates executive summaries and insights
  - Identifies top performers and products needing attention

- **EmailNotificationProcessor** (`application/processor/email_notification_processor.py`)
  - Sends performance reports via email
  - Formats content as HTML emails
  - Simulates email delivery (configurable for production SMTP)

#### 4. Criteria (2 criteria)
- **ReportReadyForEmailCriterion** (`application/criterion/report_ready_for_email_criterion.py`)
  - Validates reports are complete before email delivery
  - Checks content, metadata, and recipient configuration

- **DataExtractionScheduleCriterion** (`application/criterion/data_extraction_schedule_criterion.py`)
  - Validates extraction timing and schedule patterns
  - Supports weekly Monday scheduling as required

#### 5. API Routes (3 route groups)
- **Products API** (`application/routes/products.py`)
  - CRUD operations for Product entities
  - Performance analysis endpoints
  - Search and filtering capabilities

- **Reports API** (`application/routes/reports.py`)
  - Report generation and management
  - Email delivery triggers
  - Weekly report creation endpoint

- **Data Extractions API** (`application/routes/data_extractions.py`)
  - Extraction job management
  - Manual and scheduled extraction triggers
  - Status monitoring and retry controls

- **Error Handling**: Retry logic for failed deliveries

### 5. API Management
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced querying capabilities
- **Manual Triggers**: On-demand extraction and report generation
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time system status and metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance with type hints
