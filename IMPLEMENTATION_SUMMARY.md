# Product Performance Analysis and Reporting System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Product Performance Analysis and Reporting System, a Cyoda Python client application that retrieves data from the Pet Store API and generates performance analysis reports.

## Architecture

The system follows the Cyoda framework patterns with:
- **Interface-based design** - All entities extend CyodaEntity
- **Workflow-driven architecture** - Business logic flows through Cyoda workflows
- **Thin routes** - API endpoints are pure proxies to EntityService
- **Manual transitions** - All entity updates use explicit manual transitions

## Implemented Components

### 1. Entities

#### Pet Entity (`application/entity/pet/version_1/pet.py`)
- Represents pets from the Pet Store API
- Fields: pet_id, name, category, photo_urls, tags, status
- Performance analysis fields: performance_score, analysis_data, last_analyzed_at
- Validation for status, performance scores, and data completeness

#### Store Entity (`application/entity/store/version_1/store.py`)
- Represents store information and inventory data
- Fields: store_name, store_id, address, phone, email
- Inventory fields: inventory_data, total_pets, available_pets, pending_pets, sold_pets
- Performance metrics: performance_metrics, last_analyzed_at

#### Report Entity (`application/entity/report/version_1/report.py`)
- Represents performance analysis reports
- Fields: report_title, report_type, report_period, report_data
- Email delivery: email_recipient, email_status, email_sent_at
- Analysis metrics: total_pets_analyzed, stores_analyzed, performance_score

### 2. Workflows

#### Pet Workflow (`application/resources/workflow/pet/version_1/Pet.json`)
- States: initial_state → created → validated → analyzed → completed
- Processors: PetAnalysisProcessor for performance analysis
- Criteria: PetValidationCriterion for data validation

#### Store Workflow (`application/resources/workflow/store/version_1/Store.json`)
- States: initial_state → created → validated → inventory_synced → completed
- Processors: StoreInventoryProcessor for inventory synchronization
- Criteria: StoreValidationCriterion for data validation

#### Report Workflow (`application/resources/workflow/report/version_1/Report.json`)
- States: initial_state → created → validated → generated → emailed → completed
- Processors: ReportGenerationProcessor, ReportEmailProcessor
- Criteria: ReportValidationCriterion for data validation

### 3. Processors

#### PetAnalysisProcessor (`application/processor/pet_analysis_processor.py`)
- Analyzes pet performance based on availability, category, and data completeness
- Calculates weighted performance scores (0-100)
- Updates pet entities with analysis results

#### StoreInventoryProcessor (`application/processor/store_inventory_processor.py`)
- Retrieves inventory data from Pet Store API
- Calculates store performance metrics and rates
- Updates store entities with inventory and performance data

#### ReportGenerationProcessor (`application/processor/report_generation_processor.py`)
- Collects data from Pet and Store entities
- Generates comprehensive performance analysis reports
- Calculates overall performance scores and trends

#### ReportEmailProcessor (`application/processor/report_email_processor.py`)
- Sends performance reports via email (simulated)
- Generates HTML and text email content
- Updates report entities with email delivery status

### 4. Validation Criteria

#### PetValidationCriterion (`application/criterion/pet_validation_criterion.py`)
- Validates required fields (name)
- Checks field constraints (status, performance_score)
- Enforces business rules for data completeness

#### StoreValidationCriterion (`application/criterion/store_validation_criterion.py`)
- Validates required fields (store_name)
- Checks field formats (email, phone)
- Validates inventory data consistency

#### ReportValidationCriterion (`application/criterion/report_validation_criterion.py`)
- Validates required fields (report_title, report_type, report_period, email_recipient)
- Checks field constraints and formats
- Enforces business rules for report generation

### 5. API Routes

#### Pet Routes (`application/routes/pets.py`)
- CRUD operations: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
- List with filtering by status and category
- Workflow transitions support
- Pet Store API synchronization endpoint

#### Store Routes (`application/routes/stores.py`)
- CRUD operations: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
- List with filtering by store name
- Inventory synchronization trigger endpoint

#### Report Routes (`application/routes/reports.py`)
- CRUD operations: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
- List with filtering by report type and email status
- Weekly report creation endpoint

## Key Features

### Performance Analysis
- **Pet Performance**: Analyzes availability, category performance, and data completeness
- **Store Performance**: Calculates inventory health, availability rates, and sales rates
- **Overall Scoring**: Weighted performance scores from 0-100

### Data Integration
- **Pet Store API**: Retrieves live data from https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/
- **Inventory Sync**: Real-time inventory data synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with fallback data

### Reporting System
- **Automated Reports**: Weekly performance analysis reports
- **Email Delivery**: HTML and text email formats (simulated)

## Configuration

### Module Registration (`services/config.py`)
All processors and criteria are registered in the processor modules list:
- application.processor.pet_analysis_processor
- application.processor.store_inventory_processor
- application.processor.report_generation_processor
- application.processor.report_email_processor
- application.criterion.pet_validation_criterion

- reports_bp: /api/reports

## Usage Examples

### Creating and Analyzing a Pet
```bash
# Create a pet
POST /api/pets

  "category": {"name": "Dogs"},
  "status": "available",
  "photoUrls": ["http://example.com/photo.jpg"],
  "tags": [{"name": "friendly"}]
}

# The pet will automatically progress through:
# created → validated → analyzed → completed
```

### Synchronizing Store Inventory
```bash
# Create a store
POST /api/stores
{
  "storeName": "Pet Paradise",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "email": "store@example.com"
}

# Trigger inventory sync
POST /api/stores/{store_id}/sync-inventory
```

### Generating Weekly Reports
```bash
# Create weekly report
POST /api/reports/weekly
{
  "report_period": "2024-01-01 to 2024-01-07",
  "email_recipient": "victoria.sagdieva@cyoda.com"
}

# The report will automatically:
# created → validated → generated → emailed → completed
```
