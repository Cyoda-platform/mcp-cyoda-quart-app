Hello! I need an application that uses the Restful Booker API (https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html) to generate reports on bookings. The application should be able to: Retrieve all bookings: Fetch all bookings from the API. Filter bookings: Filter bookings based on criteria like booking dates, total price, or deposit paid status. Generate reports: Create reports summarizing booking data, including things like total revenue, average booking price, and the number of bookings within specific date ranges. The reports should be displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., table, chart).
