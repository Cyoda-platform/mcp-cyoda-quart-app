Weekly Cat Fact Subscription Hello! I want to create an application that sends subscribers a new cat fact every week using the Cat Fact API https://catfact.ninja/#/Facts/getRandomFact. The application should include: Data Ingestion: Retrieve a new cat fact from the API every week. User Interaction: Allow users to sign up for weekly cat fact emails. Publishing: Send the cat fact via email to all subscribers. Reporting: Track the number of subscribers and interactions with the cat facts. Data ingestion should be scheduled to run once a week for the email send-out.
