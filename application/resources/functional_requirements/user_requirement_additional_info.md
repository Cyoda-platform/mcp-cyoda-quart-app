Thank you for sharing your detailed requirements! Let's explore what you've outlined and make sure we cover all aspects. 

### User Subscription
- **User Story**: As a cat lover, I want to sign up for weekly cat facts via email so that I can receive interesting information about cats.
- **System Response**: The system should provide a simple form where users can enter their email address to subscribe. After subscribing, they should receive a confirmation email.

### Reporting and Analytics
- **User Story**: As an admin, I want to track the number of subscribers and their interaction with the cat facts so that I can assess engagement levels.
- **System Response**: The system should generate reports showing the total number of subscribers and any metrics related to interactions, such as open rates or clicks.

Do you have any additional user stories or functionalities in mind? For example, would you like to include options for users to manage their subscriptions (like unsubscribing or changing their email)? Also, are there any specific metrics or reports you want to track besides subscriber numbers and interactions?
