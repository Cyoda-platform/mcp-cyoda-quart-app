iGenerate Cyoda OMS Backend (UI → App APIs → Cyoda Service)

   Objective

   Build a Spring Boot client application that exposes simple REST APIs for a browser UI (no login in the browser).
   The app will hold server-side Cyoda credentials and talk to Cyoda’s standard /entity/ APIs and workflows on behalf of the UI.

   Key demo rules
   • Anonymous checkout only (no user accounts).
   • Payment (dummy) auto-approves after ~3 seconds.
   • Stock policy: decrement Product.quantityAvailable on order creation (no reservations).
   • Shipping: single shipment per order.
   • Order number: short ULID.
   • Catalog filters: category, free-text (name/description), price range.
   • Product must include category and must use the attached Product schema verbatim for persistence/round-trip (UI list can use a slim view).
