# Weather App Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete functional requirements implementation for a weather notification application that pulls data from MSC GeoMet API and sends email notifications to users.

## Application Features
- **Daily Weather Updates**: Automated weather data fetching and email delivery at 8 AM
- **Location Customization**: Users can subscribe to multiple locations
- **Email Preferences**: Customizable notification times and subscription management
- **Subscription Control**: Users can subscribe, pause, resume, and unsubscribe from notifications

## Entities Implemented

### 1. User Entity
- **Purpose**: Manages user accounts and email preferences
- **Key Attributes**: email, name, timezone, notification_time, active status
- **Workflow States**: registered → active → suspended/deleted
- **API Endpoints**: POST/PUT/GET `/api/users`

### 2. WeatherSubscription Entity
- **Purpose**: Manages location-based weather subscriptions
- **Key Attributes**: user_id, location, coordinates, frequency, active status
- **Workflow States**: created → active → paused/cancelled
- **API Endpoints**: POST/PUT/GET `/api/subscriptions`

### 3. WeatherData Entity
- **Purpose**: Stores weather information from MSC GeoMet API
- **Key Attributes**: temperature, humidity, wind_speed, weather_condition, location
- **Workflow States**: fetching → processed → notification_ready → expired
- **API Endpoints**: POST/PUT/GET `/api/weather`

### 4. EmailNotification Entity
- **Purpose**: Manages email delivery and status tracking
- **Key Attributes**: recipient_email, subject, content, delivery_status, retry_count
- **Workflow States**: pending → sending → sent/failed (with retry capability)
- **API Endpoints**: POST/PUT/GET `/api/notifications`

## Workflow Integration
1. **User Registration**: User creates account and activates it
2. **Subscription Creation**: User subscribes to weather updates for specific locations
3. **Data Fetching**: System automatically fetches weather data from MSC GeoMet API
4. **Notification Processing**: Weather data is formatted into email notifications
5. **Email Delivery**: Notifications are sent with retry logic for failed deliveries

## Key Business Rules
- Only active users receive notifications
- Maximum 3 retry attempts for failed emails
- Weather data expires after 24 hours
- Location coordinates must be valid (lat: -90 to 90, lng: -180 to 180)
- Users can have multiple subscriptions for different locations

## API Integration Points
- **MSC GeoMet API**: External weather data source
- **SMTP Email Service**: Email delivery system
- **Cyoda Platform**: Entity storage and workflow management

## Files Created
- **Entity Definitions**: 4 entity markdown files with attributes and relationships
- **Workflow Specifications**: 4 workflow markdown files with state diagrams and processors
- **API Routes**: 4 route specification files with request/response examples
- **Workflow JSON**: 4 validated workflow definitions for Cyoda platform

## Next Steps
1. Implement processor functions for each workflow
2. Set up MSC GeoMet API integration
3. Configure SMTP email service
4. Deploy workflows to Cyoda platform
5. Test end-to-end functionality

This implementation provides a complete foundation for the weather notification application as specified in the user requirements.
